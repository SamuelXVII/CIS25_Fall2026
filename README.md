# CIS25_Fall2026

Week #3 explanation:
included iostream library & namespace std (which allows for shortened cin and cout)
In main I first listed variable types and name information will be stored under.

Afterwards, I wanted to have a list of options to choose from and pricing for those items since it would make more sense.
One issue I had was orange juice not working due to the space.
Beyond simple cin and cout inputs the end involved me placing (amountPurchasing * cost) since the price would have to be multiplied by how many the user wanted (stored as amountPurchasing).

Week #4 Part 1 explanation:
I created a list of options where depending on which choice the user selects. Simple usage of if, else if and else statements.

Week#4 Part 2 explanation:
User enters three integers hence three usages of cin. I then use nestled if statements to check firstly how the first and second numbers compare.
Then I applied an nestled if to then compare the number to the third number.


Week #5 explanation:
I followed the header video instruction of creating a header file (Menu.h) as well as an implementation file (Menu.cpp). 
Naturally, #include "Menu.cpp" was placed on the top of both Menu.cpp and Week5Part1.cpp file.
The menu file contained the function definitions. Header contained the functions. The Week5 file had the main loop.
The main loop's job was to call a function based on what number was selected.
