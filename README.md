# CIS25_Fall2026

Week #3 explanation:
included iostream library & namespace std (which allows for shortened cin and cout)
In main I first listed variable types and name information will be stored under.

Afterwards, I wanted to have a list of options to choose from and pricing for those items since it would make more sense.
One issue I had was orange juice not working due to the space.
Beyond simple cin and cout inputs the end involved me placing (amountPurchasing * cost) since the price would have to be multiplied by how many the user wanted (stored as amountPurchasing).
